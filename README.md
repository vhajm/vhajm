- Hi I'm Vladimir 'junior' 🤓,
- I start to like JS 😍, 
- I spend a lot of blood 🩸 to understand 'world of programmers' 👽,
- My progress now is 0.00000001% but 🔜 it will be 100% 💪 😰,
- You can’t see it, but I’m making a very happy face right now when I programming 🙃,
- Now my code is a mess 👀 , but I am trying to make a beauty 🪄 ,
- I'm not engineer 👷🏽  but I can fix your code, trust me, I know what I am doing. 🤣
